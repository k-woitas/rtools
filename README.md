# rtools

simple tools for data handling and analysis in R


> WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using R.

The examples are presented as R markown files and their HTML rendered companions. For R Markdown see for instance https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/.

We recommend installing the current version of R and RStudio. 

Additional installation instructions for R packages required by different tools can be found in the corresponding R Markdown files.
