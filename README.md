# rtools

simple tools for data handling and analysis in R


> WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using R.

The examples are presented as R markdown files and their HTML rendered companions. Take a look at https://rtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eda/ for nice view!
Or, you may download the HTML files and open them separately if they do not show correctly by just accessing them from Github :)

We recommend installing the current version of R and RStudio. 
For R Markdown see for instance https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/.
Additional installation instructions for R packages required by different tools can be found in the corresponding R Markdown files.
