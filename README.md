# rtools

simple tools for data handling and analysis in R

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using R.

The examples are presented as R markdown files and their HTML rendered companions. Take a look at https://rtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eda/ for nice view!
Or, you may download the HTML files and open them separately if they do not show correctly by just accessing them from Github :)
